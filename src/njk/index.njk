      <h1>Austin Tourism Guide</h1>
        <p>Years ago when people talked about Austin they would quickly mention the music. But that's just the beginning of what they're saying these days. Austin is also home to a wonderful ballet, world-class museums, one-of-a-kind shopping and beautiful outdoor spaces. You can just as easily spend your morning paddling the lake as you can strolling through a celebrated history museum. And it's okay if you don't have time to fit it all in, you can just come back and visit us again.</p>
